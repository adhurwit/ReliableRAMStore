#ReliableRAMStore

A set of classes that uses the ServiceFabric ReliableDictionary to store Lucene.NET v3 indices. It is directly based on the existing RAMStore classes. 

This is only a proof of concept.

This works in conjunction with [SearchFabric](https://github.com/adhurwit/SearchFabric) - a scalable, fault-tolerant search engine. 


**Please let me know if you are interested in moving this forward**


- Version 0.1 - 8/8 - Proof of Concept


## TODO

- Design the Lucene Store classes from the ground up to use the ReliableDictionary 
- Compatibility with Lucene.NET v4
